# CarPricePrediction
 Prediction of price of the car is analysed using Multiple Linear Regression.
 
 **Problem Description:**
   There is an automobile company XYZ from Japan which aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition      to their US and European counterparts.
   They want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Japanese market. Essentially, the company      wants to know:
   
   1)Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car.
   
   2)How well those variables describe the price of a car.
   
   Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the American market.
   
   The column “Price” is the **target** variable and rest of the columns are independent variables.
   
   **Numerical variables:** [‘wheelbase’, ‘carlength’, ‘carwidth’, ‘carheight’, ‘curbweight’, ‘enginesize’, ‘boreratio’, ‘stroke’, ‘compressionratio’, ‘horsepower’, ‘peakrpm’, ‘citympg’, ‘highwaympg’]
   
   **Categorical variables:** [‘symboling’, ‘fueltype’, ‘aspiration’, ‘doornumber’, ‘carbody’, ‘drivewheel’, ‘enginelocation’, ‘enginetype’, ‘cylindernumber’, ‘fuelsystem’ ‘car_name’]
